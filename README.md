# Q-learning-approach-for-shortest-path-in-a-maze:
# Q-Learning:
Is a type of Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm used to find the optimal action-selection policy for an agent interacting with an environment. The agent learns by receiving rewards or penalties based on its actions and aims to maximize its cumulative reward over time. Q-Learning is model-free, meaning it doesn't require a model of the environment and learns from direct interactions with it.
# How Q-Learning Works:
    Initialize Q-Table: The Q-table is a matrix where rows represent states, columns represent actions, and the values are Q-values.
    Observe the Current State: The agent observes its current state in the environment.
    Choose an Action: Based on the current state, the agent selects an action using an exploration strategy (e.g., epsilon-greedy).
    Take the Action and Observe the Reward and Next State: The agent takes the action, receives a reward, and moves to the next state.
    Update the Q-Value: The Q-value for the current state-action pair is updated based on the observed reward and the maximum Q-value for the next state.
    Repeat: Steps 2-5 are repeated for many episodes until the Q-values converge.
# Summary:
 Q-Learning: An algorithm that helps an agent learn the best actions to take in an environment to maximize cumulative reward.
 The Code: Implements Q-Learning to find the shortest path in a maze by training an agent through multiple episodes and updating its Q-values based on the rewards 
            received and the best future Q-values.
